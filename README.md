# Advanced-Financial-Modeling
Hello, this is a repository for Cole Parton's Advanced Financial Modeling personal project. Within this project, I will be using a Cluster Analysis technique within the Python programming language. The purpose of this project is to cluster the SnP100 stocks based on risk and return variables. These clusters will represent security baskets of differing risk/return compositions for financial advisors to offer their clients. 
The data will be coming directly from Yahoo Finance and will consist of weekly stock prices for the SnP100 since March 20, 2020 (the bottom of the Covid market crash).
